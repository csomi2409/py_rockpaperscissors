# Rock Paper Scissors in Python | Created by Bence Csomor

Contains 1 program (``game.py``)

The ``game.py`` program has a list where the options are stored. The question is asked and the user inputs their guess. 
Then the function generates a random number and it assigns it to the index of the list. 

Used 1 module [random] 

The program runs continuously. It only stops, when the user wants it to stop.

I implemented a score system.

Source code contains comments.
